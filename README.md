# Terraform Template Repository

This repository is intended to be used as a template for creating new Terraform modules or just for writing general Terraform code

## Actions

A sample Github actions workflow is present in this repository. This will create a new release when you push a tag to any branch and this allows for your module to sync with the Terraform registry / private registry.

## Usage
- Clone the repo
- Edit the readme and remove these instructions
- Go through the optional portions if you want to use asdf and pre-commit (I recommend you use pre-commit)
